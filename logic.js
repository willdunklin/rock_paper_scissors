//We will first implement a function that generates a choice for the computer, and will
//then compare it to that of the user. The users choice will be found through element id from the html.
//In order to compare the results, we will have to make a funciton "compare" which will establish and respond with
//the winner. This compare function will be below the play function.


//this is where we will find the computers choice and compare it to the users.

//this is where we decalre how to compare the choices based on the basic rules of RPS.
//think about how a player wins/loses. What is the logic? View the flowchart for reference.
